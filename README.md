# Abstract

Proofs of strong normalization of the simply-typed lambda calculus have been exhaustively enumerated in the literature. A common strategy invented by W. W. Tait known as "Tait's method," (Robert Harper, 2022) interprets types as sets of "well-behaving" terms which are known to be strongly normalizing and composed of expressions in some such set.
Strong normalization of the typed SK combinator calculus has been comparatively under-studied. Herein, I demonstrate that the typical proof of strong normalization using Tait's method holds for the typed SK combinator calculus. I also show that decomposition of the STLC into SK combinator expressions simplifies the typical proof of strong normalization.

# A Type Discipline for the SK Combinators

I consider the usual SK combinator calculus defined as such:

A natural interpretation of the combinators as typed functions results in the dependent typing:

# Decomposition of the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus into Dependently Typed SK Combinators

I utilize an SK compilation scheme outlined in "The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages" (Peyton Jones, Simon L., 1987):

I consider a generic simply-typed lambda calculus with base types $B$, a type constructor &rarr; and the type universe:

\label{maplemma:1}

## Type Expressivity & Equivalence

I define a mapping (M<sub>t</sub>) from the &rarr; type constructor to &forall;: $(\alpha \rightarrow \beta) \mapsto \forall x : \alpha.\beta$. I also assume the existence of a mapping (M<sub>c</sub>) from the base types $B$ to arbitrary objects in my dependently-typed SK combinator calculus. Type inference is trivially derived from the above inference rules: $\forall c \in B, \exists\ t, t', c : t \implies t' = M_{t} t \implies M_{c} : t$.

It follows that every well-typed expression in our simply-typed lambda calculus has an equivalent well-typed SK expression:

# Proof

In order to prove strong normalization of the STLC, it suffices to demonstrate that a) no well-typed lambda calculus expression is inexpressible in the dependently-typed SK combinator calculus; and b) all well-typed SK combinator expressions are strongly normalizing.
