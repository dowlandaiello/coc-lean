* Strong Normalization of the Dependently Typed SK Combinators in Lean

In this repository, I define a dependent typing for the SK combinators, and prove strong normalization of this combinator calculus in Lean.

See the [[https://dowlandaiello.com/sk-lean][book]] for more.

** Table of Contents

I aim for this repository to be relatively accessible to anyone who knows Lean or functional programming. A such, I assume little theoretical background knowledge. My hope is that this book gives you a good understanding of what strong normalization is, how it's proven, and how I've proven it for the dependently typed SK combinatorsâ€“all in Lean.

1. Background - provides an overview on typing, lambda calculus, and strong normalization
2. Type Discipline - in-depth technical details of how I represent dependent typings for the SK combinators
