\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:org5bc09c5}

Proofs of strong normalization of the simply-typed lambda calculus have been exhaustively enumerated in the literature. A common strategy invented by W. W. Tait known as "Tait's method," (Robert Harper, 2022) interprets types as sets of "well-behaving" terms which are known to be strongly normalizing and composed of expressions in some such set.
Strong normalization of the typed SK combinator calculus has been comparatively under-studied. Herein, I demonstrate that the typical proof of strong normalization using Tait's method holds for the typed SK combinator calculus. I also show that decomposition of the STLC into SK combinator expressions simplifies the typical proof of strong normalization.
\section{A Type Discipline for the SK Combinators}
\label{sec:orgedbc151}

I consider the usual SK combinator calculus defined as such:

\begin{align}
& K xy = x \\
& S xyz = xz (yz)
\end{align}

A natural interpretation of the combinators as typed functions results in the dependent typing:

\label{inference:1}

\[
\inferrule
  { \Gamma \vdash A : K \ \Gamma,x : A \vdash B : L }
  { \Gamma \vdash (\forall x : A.B) : L}
\]
\[
\inferrule
  { }
  { \Gamma T_{n} : T_{n + 1} }
\]
\[
\inferrule
  { \Gamma \alpha : T_{n}, \beta : T_{m}, x : \alpha, y : \beta }
  { \Gamma \vdash K : (\forall x, y.\alpha) }
\]
\[
\inferrule
  { \Gamma \alpha : T_{n}, \beta : T_{m}, \gamma : T_{o}, x : (\forall x : \alpha, y : \beta.\gamma), y : (\forall x : \alpha.\alpha), z : \alpha }
  { \Gamma \vdash S : (\forall x, y, z.\gamma) }
\]

\section{Decomposition of the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus into Dependently Typed SK Combinators}
\label{sec:org50d4455}

I utilize an SK compilation scheme outlined in "The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages" (Peyton Jones, Simon L., 1987):

\begin{align}
(\lambda x.e_{1}\ e_{2})\ arg &= S (\lambda x.e_{1}) (\lambda x.e_{2})\ arg \\
(\lambda x.x) &= SKK \\
(\lambda x.c) &= K c
\end{align}

I consider a generic simply-typed lambda calculus with base types \(B\), a type constructor \(\rightarrow\) and the type universe:

\[
T = \{ t \mid t \in B\}\ \cup\ \{ t \mid \exists\  t_{1} \in T, t_{2} \in T, t = t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2} \}
\]

\label{maplemma:1}
\subsection{Type Expressivity \& Equivalence}
\label{sec:orgfbb2265}

I define a mapping (M\textsubscript{t}) from the \(\rightarrow\) type constructor to \(\forall\): \((\alpha \rightarrow \beta) \mapsto \forall x : \alpha.\beta\). I also assume the existence of a mapping (M\textsubscript{c}) from the base types \(B\) to arbitrary objects in my dependently-typed SK combinator calculus. Type inference is trivially derived from the above inference rules: \(\forall c \in B, \exists\ t, t', c : t \implies t' = M_{t} t \implies M_{c} : t\).

It follows that every well-typed expression in our simply-typed lambda calculus has an equivalent well-typed SK expression:

\begin{proof}
Assume (1) that for all $c \in B, \exists!\ c' \in M_{c}, c' = M_{c} c$.
Assume (2) that for all $\{t_{1}, t_{2}, t\} \subset T, t = (t_{1} \rightarrow t_{2}), \exists!\ t' \in M_{t}, t' = M_{t} t$.
Per \href{decomplemma:1}{above} and induction on (1) there exists a mapping from every lambda expression to an SK combinator expression.
It follows by induction on $e : t$, where $e$ is well-typed per the \href{decomplemma:1}{inference rules} that all $t \in$ the simply-typed $T$ are in $M_{t}$.
It suffices to conclude that all well-typed expressions have well-typed counterparts in the dependently-typed SK combinator calculus.
\end{proof}
\section{Proof}
\label{sec:org8545ac7}

In order to prove strong normalization of the STLC, it suffices to demonstrate that a) no well-typed lambda calculus expression is inexpressible in the dependently-typed SK combinator calculus; and b) all well-typed SK combinator expressions are strongly normalizing.
\subsection{Comprehensiveness of the SK Mapping}
\label{sec:org589fe24}

\begin{proof}
Suppose (1) there exists some well-typed expression $e$ of type $t \in T$ in the STLC which is not representible in the dependently-typed SK combinator calculus. By induction: \\
\begin{itemize}
\item If the expression is a constant, it must be contained in $M_{c}$, per the \href{maplemma:1}{above} lemma. \textbf{contradiction} \\
\item If the expression is a well-typed expression contained in $M_{c}$ which is a dependently-typed SK expression, its type is inferred per the \href{inference:1}{inference rules}. The expression is thus representible. \textbf{contradiction} \\
\item If the expression is a well-typed lambda expression, its type is of the form: $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$, where $\{\alpha, \beta\} \subset T$. An image must exist in $M_{t}$ per \href{maplemma:1}{above} of the form $\forall x : \alpha.\beta$. \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Its body is also well-typed, and has a valid type. Its body is thus representible \textbf{by induction}. \\
  \item The expression is thus representible, per the \href{decomplemma:1}{decomposition rules}. \textbf{contradiction} \\
\end{itemize}
\item If the expression is a well-typed application $e_{1} e_{2}$, its left hand side is of type $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$, where $\{\alpha, \beta\} \subset T$. Its right hand side must be of type $beta$. The expression is thus of type $t$. By induction, the expression is representible. \textbf{contradiction} \\
\end{itemize}

Conclusion: no expression exists which has no image in the set of well-typed dependently-typed SK combinator expressions.
\end{proof}
