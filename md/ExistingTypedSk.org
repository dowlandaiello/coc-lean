* Existing Work: Typed SK Combinators

** Definition of the SK Combinators

1. [On the building blocks of mathematical logic](https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2020/12/Schonfinkel-OnTheBuildingBlocksOfMathematicalLogic.pdf)
- Schonfinkel demonstrates that the \\(I\\) combiantor (\\(I x\\) = x\\)) can be constructed using only \\(K\\) (or by the name \\(C\\)) and \\(S\\).
